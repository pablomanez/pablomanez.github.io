	<p>In this case, is an individual project: Consists of a combined game of Tetris and Street Fighter.</p>
	<p>The objective of the game is make lines as in the Tetris but with a little change: When you make a line the enemy health goes down. For the same reason, when you make a Tetris! move (doing 4 lines  at the same time) the damage is increased.</p>
